# Awesome-Unofficial-Implementation-with-Explanations
# Paper Implementation Challenge Hub

This project aims to create a collaborative environment where users can upload difficult-to-implement research papers that are not open-sourced. Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts can come together to discuss, clarify, and implement complex parts of these papers. The goal is to foster a knowledge-sharing community that bridges the gap between theory and practice.

## Project Purpose
1. **Upload challenging papers**: Upload papers that are difficult to implement, describing unclear parts and required implementations.
2. **Collaborative solving**: Other users with strong theoretical and implementation skills can respond and contribute publicly to the repository.
3. **Knowledge sharing**: All solutions and implementations are publicly available for educational and research purposes.

## How to Participate

### For Paper Submitters:
1. **Fork the repository** and create a new folder under the `papers/` directory.
2. Name the folder after the paper’s title or a concise identifier.
3. In the folder, include:
   - **Paper information**: A summary of the paper, link to the paper, and the specific parts that are difficult to understand or implement.
   - **Unclear sections**: Provide details on which sections of the paper require clarification or implementation help.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with your folder.

### For Contributors:
1. Browse the issues tagged with `#help-wanted` or explore the `papers/` directory.
2. Pick a topic where you can contribute (either by clarifying the theory or writing code).
3. Fork the repository and create a subfolder in the specific paper's folder where you will place your implementation or explanation.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with your contribution.

### Contribution Format
Each folder should contain:
- `summary.md`: A brief description of the paper, what the challenge is, and the community's progress.
- `implementation/`: A subfolder where the implementation code and explanations are stored.

### Example Structur
```
papers/
│   
└───paper1-title/
│   │   summary.md
│   └───implementation/
│       └───code.py
│   
└───paper2-title/
    │   summary.md
    └───implementation/
        └───script.py
```


## Guidelines
1. Be respectful and constructive when contributing.
2. Always give credit to the original authors of the papers and cite them properly in your PRs.
